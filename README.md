# CLI Quote Quiz 🕹️

This is a simple terminal-based quiz based on some quotes my friends have said. The game is simple. Guess who said the quote or be deemed a **fake friend!**

## Getting Started
Make sure you have ```node v20+``` installed. Clone the repo and install all the required dependencies by running ```npm install```. Then Start the game by running ```node index.js``` or ```node .```. Enjoy.
